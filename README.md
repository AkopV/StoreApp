# StoreApp

Requirements:

• First screen is a list of products. Product has name and price.

• Provided view (button, menu item) to sort elements by name and by price.

• Saved app state. By app state I mean previous sorting criteria. So when you

exit app, kill it and open it again - app state is restored.
